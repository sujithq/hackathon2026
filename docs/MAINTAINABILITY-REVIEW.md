# Maintainability Review Findings

Reviewed: 2026-09-12

Scope: First-blocker setting guidance in the primary Compass client, including exact Engine identity/metadata mapping, editor boundaries, render/focus lifecycle, shared field styling, tests and documentation. Shared contracts, the other clients and deployment configuration were checked for affected behavior and remain unchanged. Earlier navigation, bundle-tool, flow and whole-solution findings are preserved below.

Status: Blocker guidance is implemented and reviewed with no open findings. F-31 and F-32 are resolved; all 550 Release tests, the Release build, and desktop/mobile browser checks passed. F-01 through F-30 remain resolved.

## Review Principles

- Keep reusable simulation and business behavior in the client-neutral Engine.
- Keep Web limited to rendering, browser persistence, UI state, and client orchestration.
- Preserve deterministic behavior, stable identifiers, ordered explanations, first-failing-gate semantics, and projected balances.
- Resolve applicability, entitlement, and state transitions from the same selected entity identity.

## Blocker Setting Review

Reviewed: 2026-09-12 against current staged, unstaged and untracked changes. Scope includes the primary page, page model, configuration/results/number-field components, browser reveal helper, shared styles and tests. The existing Engine result determines the blocker; no client-side cost, applicability, entitlement or simulation algorithm was added. The Advanced client, shared bundle format, tool and deployment workflow are unchanged.

### F-31: A reused ID could highlight an earlier passed control

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved during post-fix review.
- Evidence: [`CompassPageModel.cs:34`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Services/CompassPageModel.cs#L34) initially selected the first applied guardrail matching `FirstFailingGate`, without requiring a terminal failure outcome. IDs can be reused across different guardrail collections.
- Impact: A passed ULB and later failed spending budget with the same ID could highlight the wrong setting and display the wrong message.
- Resolution: Require a matching ID and an actual Blocked, Indeterminate, SoftStopped or Waiting outcome. Resolve the setting using stable Common metadata plus the exact record ID retained by the existing editor adapter.
- Dependencies: Preserve the Engine's first-failing-gate result and keep UI field mapping client-specific.
- Verification: A regression reuses an ID across a passing ULB and blocked AI budget, asserting the budget input and its failure message are selected.

### F-32: Snapshot-only blockers must not target a different guided control

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved during mapping review.
- Evidence: The guided client edits one selected cost-center budget and the first Actions budget; paid-usage enablement does not edit its product/SKU authorization lists. The [setting resolver](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Services/CompassPageModel.cs#L38) now checks the represented record/property and supplies an [exact-record view](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Shared/Compass/CompassConfiguration.razor#L7) otherwise.
- Impact: Mapping only by category could highlight a passing first budget or an enabled paid-usage dropdown while the actual blocker is another record or a product restriction.
- Resolution: Highlight guided controls only when their exact ID and represented property match. Otherwise show the actual blocking record with its available limit/consumption/request values and a non-mutating bundle inspection action.
- Dependencies: Reuse the existing editor-selected IDs and Common labels/units. The fallback is a read-only view of Engine output, not an invented editor or guessed policy.
- Verification: Regressions cover an imported enterprise budget, a later Actions budget, and paid-product authorization mismatch; bundle inspection preserves scenario bytes and balances.

### Ranked Low-Hanging Fruit

| Rank | Finding | Severity | Effort | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | F-31 | Medium | Small | Resolved; failed record identity required |
| 2 | F-32 | Medium | Small | Resolved; exact-field mapping or snapshot view |

Behavior and validation:

- Only the current first blocker is marked, using an outline plus visible and screen-reader-associated text. Editing, import/reset and successful results clear stale highlights. Unsupported-evidence outcomes without a first failing check do not guess a target.
- Result evaluation expands the containing Actions/access sections. The [explicit review action](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Shared/Compass/CompassResults.razor#L77) reopens all collapsed ancestors and focuses/scrolls to the setting through the [browser reveal helper](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/wwwroot/js/app.js#L15); automatic highlighting does not steal focus. Browser reveal respects reduced-motion preferences and does not alter simulation state.
- All 41 Compass tests passed without warnings after saving pending editor buffers. Initial terminal runs against older saved files were not counted as verification of the new regressions; the temporary VS Code task synchronized the current sources before validation.
- Desktop (1440x900) and mobile (390x844) browser checks verified paid-usage/Actions highlighting, first-control identity, automatic expansion, reopening after manual collapse, focus, no horizontal overflow, and nested bundle-editor reveal. Scenario inspection left balances unchanged and no app errors were logged.
- Two test fixtures initially defaulted to alert-only enforcement; they were corrected to explicit hard stops and the same tests rerun. No production enforcement behavior changed.
- Final Release solution suite: 550 passed, zero failures or skips, including all 132 Web tests. Release solution build with `--no-restore` succeeded with zero warnings/errors. Both use isolated `artifacts/blocker-settings-validation` outputs to avoid contention with other editor builds. Editor diagnostics are clear.
- `git diff --check` passed after synchronizing the final documentation. The temporary validation task was removed; screenshots remain in ignored artifacts. No deployment or commit was performed, and no fix for the earlier hosted startup report is implied.

## Legacy Navigation Review

Reviewed: 2026-09-12 against the latest staged, unstaged and untracked working tree. Scope includes both Web layouts, page navigation, configuration help, shared CSS, regressions and directly related documentation. Common, Engine, Bundles, BundleTool, persistence contracts and deployment configuration are unchanged by this navigation fix.

Result: No concrete correctness, accessibility, maintainability or regression findings remain. Implementation effort: Small. Resolution status: Complete. Ranked low-hanging fruit: None outstanding; no new finding IDs were needed.

- Disabled all six links to pages using the legacy layout: [`Compass.razor:42`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Pages/Compass.razor#L42), [`CompassConfiguration.razor:237`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Shared/Compass/CompassConfiguration.razor#L237), [`MainLayout.razor:14`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Layout/MainLayout.razor#L14), and [`Guide.razor:13`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Pages/Guide.razor#L13).
- Link labels remain visible with `role="link"`, `aria-disabled="true"`, and a tooltip. Removing `href` and leaving no click handler or tab stop prevents navigation independently of CSS. The narrowly scoped [disabled-link style](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/wwwroot/css/app.css#L80) supplies subdued appearance and a non-action cursor without changing active links.
- Dependencies preserved: route declarations and the default layout are unchanged; direct `/advanced` and `/guide` URLs remain available. Cost Compass return links, Decision flow, Sources & scope and external documentation links remain active. This is navigation disabling, not an access-control boundary or removal of the legacy pages.
- Regression coverage in [`CompassTests.cs:119`](../tests/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web.Tests/CompassTests.cs#L119) and [`SharedComponentTests.cs:11`](../tests/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web.Tests/SharedComponentTests.cs#L11) covers the primary page, nested configuration help, legacy navigation and guide action, plus retained destinations.

Validation baseline:

- Both focused navigation tests passed, followed by all 540 Release solution tests (including 122 Web tests), with zero failures or skips.
- Release solution build succeeded with zero warnings/errors; editor diagnostics are clear. Commands used `--artifacts-path artifacts/legacy-navigation-validation` to avoid an existing locked temporary WebAssembly output from another build; no user processes were stopped.
- Local browser checks at 1440x900 and 390x844 confirmed disabled appearance, accessible disabled roles, no navigation/focus on disabled links and no horizontal overflow. Direct `/guide` rendered with working return links and external references.
- `git diff --check` passed. Screenshots are in ignored validation artifacts. No commit or deployment was performed, and this change does not establish a fix for the earlier hosted-app loading report.

## Bundle Tool Phase Reviews

Reviewed 2026-09-12 against the staged, unstaged and untracked working tree. No implementation changes were made outside the approved tool, shared serialization extraction and directly related integration/configuration/documentation.

### F-27: Collection pagination and body failures could lose evidence

- Severity: High
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved during HTTP-boundary review.
- Evidence: [`GitHubReadClient.cs:50`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.BundleTool/GitHubReadClient.cs#L50) previously checked next-link host/path but did not preserve filters or require consecutive pages. Header-read completion alone did not bound body reads; the current [page deadline](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.BundleTool/GitHubReadClient.cs#L121) covers that path.
- Impact: A dropped user filter, skipped/repeated page or stalled response could undermine source completeness or leave collection unfinished.
- Resolution: Pagination validates host, resource, filter, page-size and sequence invariants, rejects repeated contents/changing totals, and applies byte/page/request limits. A bounded page deadline includes response-body reads; transport failures are sanitized. Redirects remain disabled and only GET is constructed.
- Dependencies: The collector separately verifies unique seats against `total_seats` and budget totals; source failure never becomes an empty configuration.
- Verification: 15 focused HTTP tests passed, including duplicate-grant pages, resource pagination, external hosts, dropped filters, skipped/repeated pages, 401/403/404/429/503, redirects, cancellation and byte limits.

### F-28: Effective per-user budget evidence was not reconciled

- Severity: High
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved during collector/mapping review.
- Evidence: [`SnapshotFinancialMapper.cs:122`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.BundleTool/SnapshotFinancialMapper.cs#L122) initially consumed group-state rows without checking the separately returned effective budget or per-user target; replayed usage periods also lacked reconciliation in [`SnapshotIdentityResolver.cs:185`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.BundleTool/SnapshotIdentityResolver.cs#L185).
- Impact: Conflicting observations could produce the wrong ULB headroom or attach evidence from a different period to a current snapshot.
- Resolution: Cross-check returned effective identity with the Engine resolver, reconcile targets/consumption or require explicit numeric confirmation, and validate replayed report period/user/cutoff. Preserve date-only expiry boundaries and separate Actions accounting.
- Dependencies: Existing Engine attribution, applicability and balance calculators remain authoritative; no simulation algorithm or supported date window changed.
- Verification: Focused tests cover effective-ID mismatch, target mismatch, group versus per-user consumption, missing values, expiry fallback, wrong-month replay and independent Actions-budget blocking.

### F-29: File/report error paths needed explicit preservation

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved during command/file review.
- Evidence: [`ImportFiles.cs:52`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.BundleTool/ImportFiles.cs#L52) and [`BundleToolApplication.cs:171`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.BundleTool/BundleToolApplication.cs#L171) required filesystem-alias collision handling and report failure/cancellation classification alongside atomic bundle writes.
- Impact: An alias could name an input as output, or a report failure could leave a misleading successful command result.
- Resolution: Resolve filesystem aliases before target checks, refuse linked-file overwrite and input/report/output collisions, write each file through sibling temporary storage, and classify report failures/cancellation explicitly. Report and bundle are documented as separate commits, not a multi-file transaction.
- Dependencies: Validation and preview finish before publishing a bundle; output replacement remains opt-in.
- Verification: Command tests pass for invalid-input preservation, overwrite refusal, path collision, cancellation, UTF-8 byte limits, stdout JSON, partial collection evidence and unwritable report preservation.

### F-26: Creation reports dropped Engine assumptions

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved during offline CLI review.
- Evidence: [`SnapshotAssembler.cs:84`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.BundleTool/SnapshotAssembler.cs#L84) initially replaced the inspector's diagnostic list with import diagnostics.
- Impact: A valid file could omit the Engine's profile/evidence caveats in its creation report.
- Resolution: Preserve both diagnostic lists; include typed confirmations, unapplied-confirmation warnings and incomplete optional-source diagnostics.
- Dependencies: Shared v1 envelope/hash serialization remains unchanged; additional report fields are tool-only contracts.
- Verification: The command test compares every validation diagnostic with the creation report.

### F-30: Incompatible bundles used the syntax-error exit code

- Severity: Low
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved during final review.
- Evidence: [`SnapshotAssembler.cs:123`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.BundleTool/SnapshotAssembler.cs#L123) previously allowed codec compatibility errors to reach the CLI's generic JSON-syntax handler.
- Impact: Automation could not reliably distinguish malformed input (`2`) from an incompatible schema/fingerprint (`4`) as documented.
- Resolution: Parse JSON syntax first, then translate codec contract failures into `bundle-incompatible` with exit `4`; syntax failures remain `2`.
- Dependencies: The shared codec's existing exception behavior and Web import semantics are unchanged.
- Verification: All 14 command tests passed after repair, including malformed syntax and corrupted fingerprint with input preservation; final solution validation also passed.

### Ranked Low-Hanging Fruit

| Rank | Finding | Severity | Effort | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | F-27 | High | Small | Resolved; bounded, filter-preserving collection |
| 2 | F-28 | High | Small | Resolved; selected-user/period evidence reconciled |
| 3 | F-29 | Medium | Small | Resolved; atomic output and report failures tested |
| 4 | F-26 | Medium | Small | Resolved; complete diagnostics retained |
| 5 | F-30 | Low | Small | Resolved; documented validation exit codes |

Phase baseline:

- Shared codec extraction: all 17 existing bundle tests and all 119 then-existing Web tests passed.
- Latest tool suite: 65 Release tests passed with no build warnings/errors.
- CLI-to-primary-Compass file import: the new focused bUnit test passed, preserving both cost-center seat assignments, selected-user ULB/spending values, catalog fingerprint, first blocker and immutable repeated previews.
- Bundles depends on Engine; BundleTool depends on Bundles, not Web. Web's only implementation changes are the shared-library reference and existing file-size constant reuse. Web.Tests references the executable solely for integration tests.
- No private enterprise was queried. Authenticated endpoint compatibility remains a credential-dependent residual risk.

Final validation, 2026-09-12:

- Release solution tests: 538 passed, zero failures or skips, including 65 tool tests and 120 Web tests.
- Release solution build with `--no-restore`: succeeded with zero warnings/errors.
- Direct and transitive NuGet vulnerability audit: none reported from the configured package source.
- Original versus relocated serializer sources: exact match after namespace and shared size-constant normalization, preserving the v1 wire format/hash algorithm and legacy import.
- Local pack/install and installed help/create/validate outside the repository passed; validation left bundle bytes unchanged. The archive includes Common, Engine, Bundles, System.CommandLine and its guide, with no Web/browser dependency.
- Added the equivalent Linux pack/install/create/validate CI step without changing deployment permissions or Pages configuration. That remote CI run and live authenticated enterprise collection were not executed locally.
- Refreshed package reinstalled successfully after releasing a local archive-inspection handle. Its installed DLL hash matches the final Release build; installed success and incompatible-input exit paths passed outside the repository.
- `git diff --check` passed, and separate no-index whitespace checks covered all 28 untracked files without staging them. No implementation findings remain open.

## Current Implementation Alignment Review

Result: No concrete correctness, maintainability, extensibility, security, or material regression-risk mismatch was found between the implementation and the maintained local financial flow.

- Pipeline order matches the documented boundary: billing attribution and selected-seat validation precede runtime/access and pricing; AI economics precede the final Actions spending decision. First-failing termination prevents later budget evaluation after an earlier denial.
- Economic evaluation uses request-sized ULB headroom, the non-negative minimum of pool and applicable included-control headroom, configurable split behavior, paid authorization only for a metered remainder, every applicable hard spending budget, and alert emission only for accepted usage.
- Attribution resolves the licensing organization before direct/team/organization cost-center precedence, then reuses the same resolved identity for seat, ULB, included-control, organization fallback, enterprise exclusion, and spending-budget applicability.
- Terminal results are atomic: blocked, indeterminate, waiting, soft-stopped, and partially simulated outcomes accept no allocation or alerts; an Actions budget rejection also restores unchanged AI and Actions balances. Required costs and applied checks remain observable separately.
- Cost Compass uses copied scenarios and never advances working balances. The Advanced simulator explicitly labels repeat-and-advance behavior and carries state forward only after allowed runs.
- `CompassPreviewProfile` enforces the documented Business/Enterprise date window, supported Chat/CLI/private cloud-agent workloads, standard Linux runner assumptions, whole pre-accounted Actions minutes, and cost-only exclusions.

Residual risk: Individual and legacy branches remain explanatory rather than implemented Compass paths. Supplied attribution, access, consumption, and account/payment states are offline assumptions, not live GitHub observations. The advanced catalog supports `MeterEntireRequest`, while the diagram deliberately presents the default split policy.

Validation at `362c784` (`docs(flows): preserve upstream and refresh AI-credit decision flow`):

- Release tests passed: 465 total.
- Release build succeeded with zero warnings and errors.
- No vulnerable direct or transitive NuGet packages were reported from the configured package source.
- The reviewed worktree was clean before this required ledger update.

### Rendered Decision-Flow Integration Review

Status: Implemented and reviewed 2026-09-12; no open findings.

- Embedded the maintained Mermaid diagram directly in the primary Cost Compass page as a full-width "How the result is decided" section with in-page navigation, scroll, zoom, fit-to-width, and responsive desktop/mobile presentation. The former `/flow` route redirects to this section.
- The checked-in `.mmd` asset is extracted from [`decision-flow.md`](decision-flow.md), and tests reject source drift. Mermaid `11.17.2` is pinned through npm, loaded only when the embedded section approaches the viewport or is explicitly opened, shipped with its MIT notice, and protected by a generated SHA-256/version manifest verified by tests.
- Browser review caught and repaired a Blazor/Mermaid DOM-ownership exception caused by replacing framework-managed loading markup. A second mobile review repaired restored loading state and off-screen initial positioning after component rerenders.
- Independent post-fix review required visibility-deferred loading with disposal cleanup, retry after a failed runtime load, theme-responsive rerendering through the guarded render path, license distribution, equivalent screen-reader flow content, true fit-to-width behavior, generated-bundle integrity coverage, control interop tests, and focus restoration for the former route. Later review repaired the former route for non-root GitHub Pages base paths, made initialization and render failure/retry transitions clear loading and alert state deterministically, and prevented theme rerenders from stealing focus from the theme button. A final review added semantic group/region roles and prevented empty or completed loading/error placeholders from entering the accessibility tree. All were implemented before final validation.
- Final browser checks confirmed the Cost Compass in-page link renders and focuses the embedded section, the former `/flow` URL redirects there, all 54 nodes render inside `.compass-shell` with no console/page errors, theme switching regenerates the SVG, named control-group and scroll-region semantics remain exposed, mobile starts at readable zoom and can fit to width, and no body overflow or overlapping content is introduced.

Validation:

- Release tests passed: 472 total.
- Release build succeeded with zero warnings and errors.
- Focused Web tests passed: 119 total.
- `npm audit` reported zero vulnerabilities.
- `git diff --check` passed.

## Resolved Decision-Flow Findings

The core budget sequence remains useful: effective ULB precedence, cost-center included controls, shared pool, paid authorization only for overflow, scoped spending budgets, and enterprise exclusions. The following changes are necessary before presenting the diagram as a precise request evaluator or current Compass execution flow.

### F-20: Capacity checks do not consistently use remaining, request-sized headroom

- Severity: High
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved upstream 2026-09-12.
- Evidence: External `docs/decision-flow.md:21-24,36-46,56-61` compares X with an "allowance"/ULB, asks whether a cost-center cap is already reached, and permits a hard budget that "has room." Current Engine checks the requested credits against remaining ULB/control capacity in `src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Guardrails/EconomicGuardrailEvaluator.cs:77-123,162-199`, and metered USD against remaining budget headroom at `338-344`.
- Impact: A request can fit the total monthly limit, or find some positive headroom, yet exceed the remaining amount. A partially remaining cost-center cap must still constrain the included portion of a crossing request.
- Required correction: Define X as the incremental requested credits; subtract existing consumption at every capacity check. Ask whether this request would exceed the remaining cap. Compute a provisional included/metered split using both pool and applicable control headroom. A hard budget must cover the proposed metered charge, not merely be nonzero.
- Example: A USD 0.40 proposed charge does not fit a USD 0.20 remaining hard budget. For the Compass demo, 100 required credits with 60 remaining requires 40 metered credits, not 100.
- Dependencies: Preserve effective ULB selection and the first-failing-stage contract. Do not present simulator request sizing as a documented guarantee of GitHub's internal billing granularity.
- Resolution: External `docs/decision-flow.md` now defines X as incremental requested credits, compares individual allowance and effective ULB requests with `limit - consumed`, calculates included headroom from the shared pool and applicable cost-center cap, derives the provisional metered remainder, and requires every hard budget to cover the complete proposed metered charge. The canonical repository flow already documents the same rules, and the Engine required no runtime change.
- Verification: Upstream commit [`5e16df4`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/5e16df4a9a56c036a458ab61e74bb486b1792b05), blob `d580ea65417116cd01fd6ef01edbb422103bdba0`, was re-read after commit. Its predicates match [`Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md`](../Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md), [`EconomicGuardrailEvaluator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Guardrails/EconomicGuardrailEvaluator.cs), and the existing Compass preview regressions.

### F-21: The diagram consumes partial included credits before later rejection

- Severity: High
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved upstream 2026-09-12.
- Evidence: External `docs/decision-flow.md:45-50` routes "Consume any remaining pool credits" into a paid-policy gate that can reject the request. Current `src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/SimulationPipelineContext.cs:24-46` returns zero accepted allocation/reservations/alerts on non-allowed results. `src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/SimulationPreviewService.cs:12-49` evaluates a copied snapshot without advancing the input.
- Impact: Used literally as a Compass algorithm, the diagram spends remaining credits on a rejected preview and conflates required usage with accepted consumption.
- Required correction: Rename pre-approval consumption to "Project included allocation and metered remainder." Show acceptance only after every modeled gate succeeds; a blocked Compass preview retains balances. Live work already performed and billed is a separate concern, not something this diagram establishes.
- Dependencies: F-20 defines the split; preserve immutable preview versus explicit session advancement.
- Resolution: External `docs/decision-flow.md` now treats the included/metered split as a neutral projection, labels successful terminal paths as acceptance, and states that paid-policy or spending-budget rejection accepts zero credits and leaves balances unchanged. It also distinguishes transactional simulator preview semantics from live work already performed and billed.
- Verification: Upstream commit [`3e42a5e`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/3e42a5e6c7608b1eafddd11077cc80eb5857b3e0), blob `2cb0c358cb53da902899f506f6092488958ad0a1`, was re-read after commit. The result matches [`SimulationPipelineContext.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/SimulationPipelineContext.cs), [`SimulationPreviewService.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/SimulationPreviewService.cs), and existing blocked-preview regressions.

### F-22: Metered-budget exits overstate both blocking and unrestricted usage

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved upstream 2026-09-12.
- Evidence: External `docs/decision-flow.md:29-33` makes a personal budget shortfall a block without representing alert-only enforcement. Lines `59-61` combine "$0 budget" with hard stops and label a missing/disabled stop "uncapped." The current official [budget setup guide](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/how-tos/set-up-budgets) distinguishes alerts from stops for personal and organizational budgets. The [individual](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing-and-usage/individuals/billing) and [organizational](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing-and-usage/organizations-and-enterprises/billing) billing pages both say additional usage may be capped and may require payment before continuing.
- Impact: Disabling one budget's stop can appear to override another applicable hard budget or guarantee unlimited billable usage. Conversely, an alert-only personal budget can appear to deny usage.
- Required correction: First evaluate every applicable hard limit, then distinguish alert-only/missing budgets. Use "No cap from these configured spending budgets; other account/payment/service limits still apply," not unconditional "uncapped." Keep additional-usage authorization distinct from a budget's enforcement mode.
- Qualification: The official organizational budget page contains both broad "any $0 budget" wording and metered-only/stop-enabled descriptions. Do not resolve that ambiguity by claiming every USD 0 control blocks fully included requests. The current Engine explicitly honors enforcement mode; ULBs are always hard stops.
- Dependencies: F-20; account/cohort-specific payment limits remain outside the Compass profile.
- Resolution: External `docs/decision-flow.md` now keeps additional-usage authorization separate from budget enforcement, evaluates all applicable hard budgets before alert-only or missing-budget outcomes, blocks a USD 0 budget only when it is a hard stop, and qualifies nonblocking outcomes with other account, payment, and service limits.
- Verification: Upstream commit [`771aa1f`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/771aa1f2fec2501e433712a27396c0ef9ef07de1), blob `5081d00eca64fde2a9c4a729b14877cf24951036`, was re-read after commit. Mixed hard-stop and alert-only paths preserve F-20 request-sized checks and F-21 transactional acceptance.

### F-23: "Direct cost center" omits valid resolved attribution routes

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved upstream 2026-09-12.
- Evidence: External `docs/decision-flow.md:52-54` restricts the cost-center branch label to direct assignment. The official [budget guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing-and-usage/organizations-and-enterprises/budgets) allows assignment directly, through an enterprise team, or through an organization. `src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Guardrails/EconomicGuardrailApplicabilityResolver.cs:64-107` consumes the resolved cost center and selects its applicable budgets before the organization fallback and non-excluded enterprise restriction.
- Impact: Team- or organization-assigned members can be routed to the wrong budget. The billing family must also follow the billed identity/licensing source rather than an unrelated personal subscription.
- Required correction: Use "Resolved cost center / applicable cost-center budget" and make prior billing attribution an explicit prerequisite. Preserve documented enterprise-budget exclusions and the existing organization fallback.
- Dependencies: Preserve F-01 selected-seat identity and the existing attribution resolver; no new parallel client-side resolution logic.
- Resolution: External `docs/decision-flow.md` now resolves billed identity, licensing source, and cost-center attribution before ULB or allocation checks; identifies direct-user, enterprise-team, and licensing-organization routes; and uses "Resolved cost center" for metered-budget applicability. The same resolved identity governs downstream ULB, included-control, budget, and enterprise-exclusion decisions.
- Verification: Upstream commit [`5d8d42f`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/5d8d42f3330bf52db6547684337c6bf30dfdf544), blob `fdccd5c1415a2e8ec2edeffd5f7c0f1e94463cdf`, was re-read after commit and compared with [`EconomicGuardrailApplicabilityResolver.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Guardrails/EconomicGuardrailApplicabilityResolver.cs) and the F-01 selected-seat invariant.

### F-24: Financial approval is presented without explicit execution and product boundaries

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small for labels; larger only if unsupported cases are implemented.
- Status: Resolved upstream 2026-09-12.
- Evidence: External `docs/decision-flow.md:7-17,25,32,48,61,80-87` covers multiple billing families and ends at "served" or "metered." `src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/CompassPreviewProfile.cs:11-74` deliberately limits Compass to B/E September scenarios and supported workloads. `src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs:36-245,253-321` includes attribution/seat, runtime/access, tariff, economics, and a separate later Actions spending check. Current official [code-review documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review) includes organization-paid unlicensed reviews outside the ordinary user's included-pool/ULB path.
- Impact: Readers may mistake an AI-budget overview for a complete guarantee that a task runs, that no separate Actions charge exists, or that Compass implements the personal/legacy branches.
- Required correction: Label the diagram an AI-credit financial subflow, with access, model availability/eligibility, effective pricing, and workload costing as prerequisites; exclude Actions and special review attribution explicitly. Use "AI-credit funding permitted" rather than unconditional "served." If used to describe Compass, mark personal/legacy branches unsupported and retain indeterminate/waiting/soft-stop/partial and unpriced outcomes outside this subflow.
- Dependencies: Keep Engine-owned trace and preview contracts authoritative; no reusable rules duplicated in Web.
- Resolution: External `docs/decision-flow.md` is now labeled an AI-credit financial subflow; identifies access/runtime, model availability/eligibility, pricing, and workload costing as prerequisites; uses funding-permitted terminals; and states that execution is not guaranteed. Boundaries separately identify Actions metering, special unlicensed code-review attribution, unsupported Compass personal/legacy branches, and Engine outcomes omitted from the compact diagram.
- Verification: Upstream commit [`f03476d`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/f03476df85cc7ac0fb9472b02e00bc5ae15830eb), blob `b6e12c27a569170405abc5e8d4010abbdfa21ed6`, was re-read after commit and compared with the Engine stage ordering and [`CompassPreviewProfile.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/CompassPreviewProfile.cs).

### F-25: Time-sensitive allowance and migration claims lack a current evidence boundary

- Severity: Low
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved upstream 2026-09-12.
- Evidence: External `docs/decision-flow.md:3,16-17,20-29` is dated 2026-08-25, gives personal totals without base/flex qualification, and asserts an exclusion for current/former Mobile subscribers plus mandatory annual-term downgrade. The current official [individual billing page](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing-and-usage/individuals/billing) confirms 1,500/7,000/20,000 totals but identifies flex as variable. Its reset is 00:00 UTC on the first calendar day, not the subscription invoice date.
- Required correction: Keep the currently correct totals, label them dated base-plus-variable-flex values, and spell out the reset boundary. Preserve historic migration branches only with an applicable dated official source and cohort. The current/former Mobile exclusion and mandatory legacy annual downgrade were not reconfirmed on the current individual billing, plan, or plan-management pages checked in this review; absence is not proof that those rules were repealed.
- Dependencies: Use the existing dated source manifest for Compass. Do not overwrite the preserved pre-implementation analysis or invent personal-plan support to match the diagram.
- Resolution: External `docs/decision-flow.md` and its source-of-truth `docs/research.md` now use a 2026-09-12 evidence date, identify individual totals as fixed base plus variable flex, state the `00:00:00 UTC` first-calendar-day reset, and scope the automatic downgrade to the existing annual Pro/Pro+ legacy cohort documented by GitHub's legacy billing page. The unconfirmed current/former GitHub Mobile exclusion was removed in favor of account-specific additional-usage authorization.
- Verification: Decision-flow commit [`6a294c6`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/6a294c631842c6005195190995a3e0fdda84c37f), blob `6afce95bcbeeef22c8ba6045966e9db25128be96`, and research commits [`8a5d747`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/8a5d747a758b8b0665c4a2971b74f22aacbd7ee7) and [`091c833`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/091c833f07d3189ae9bec9408f38008f00e410ac), final blob `9b146879db5cadcd3f561029d900229c51d776ec`, were re-read after commit. Claims were checked against the current official individual billing, plans, plan-management, and cohort-specific legacy billing pages.

## Resolved Whole-Solution Findings

### F-01: Plan entitlement depends on the client

- Severity: High
- Effort: Medium
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs) validated that `Scenario.PlanId` existed but did not reconcile it with the effective seat. [`WorkloadEditorAdapter.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Services/WorkloadEditorAdapter.cs) performed that synchronization only for Web.
- Impact: Other Engine clients can calculate an entitlement from a seat plan that conflicts with the scenario's selected plan. Equivalent user intent can therefore produce client-dependent results.
- Resolution: Engine now resolves the attributed user's effective seat at the simulation timestamp and enforces selected-plan consistency independently of Web. A conflicting known plan is rejected as an invalid scenario contract; missing or ambiguous seats produce explicit indeterminate outcomes; unknown seat plans retain the existing seat-inventory outcome.
- Verification: Engine tests cover matching plans in both simulation scopes, case-insensitive identity, conflicting plans, missing assignments, future and expired assignments, unrelated-user assignments, and multiple effective assignments.

### F-02: Actions budget failures precede economic failures

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs) evaluated Actions budgets before economic guardrails. The canonical phases in [`Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md`](../Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md) put the secondary Actions meter after economic allocation.
- Impact: When both meters fail, the result reports the wrong first failing constraint and produces a trace inconsistent with the documented pipeline.
- Resolution: Actions access preflight remains early, while the calculated Actions budget is now evaluated only after economic guardrails allow the operation.
- Verification: A simultaneous-failure regression asserts that the economic budget is first, and the existing Actions-only rejection test confirms that rejected operations do not allocate AI credits.

### F-03: Repeated unbilled operations consume runtime state

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`SimulationSessionRunner.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/SimulationSessionRunner.cs) advanced model-call count and requested duration after every allowed result. [`CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs) intentionally skips runtime evaluation for unbilled operations.
- Impact: Repetition can exhaust runtime controls for work that did not pass through those controls.
- Resolution: Full-scope sessions now advance runtime state only when the result contains evaluated model calls, and consumed call count comes from the result.
- Verification: Session tests cover billed, unevaluated/unbilled, cost-only, and partially simulated repeated operations.

### F-04: Import and restoration are not transactional

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small to medium
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`HomePageModel.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Services/HomePageModel.cs) mutated catalog/scenario state before all deserialization, adapter mapping, validation, and simulation steps succeeded. Its import and reload filters did not cover every failure produced before Engine validation. Failed catalog application did not stop saved-scenario restoration.
- Impact: Malformed but syntactically valid input can escape normal UI error handling or leave mixed old/new state while reporting a successful load.
- Resolution: Catalog application, saved-state restoration, and import now prepare configuration, Engine, scenario, form, and results before committing live page state. Guided reload handles the same domain failures without replacing the existing form.
- Verification: Focused tests cover malformed imports, invalid saved catalogs, invalid saved scenarios, and preservation of configuration, catalog JSON, scenario JSON, form, results, and display preferences.

### F-05: The result balance contract is incomplete

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Medium to large
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`SimulationResult.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/SimulationResult.cs) could not represent remaining spending-budget headroom. [`EconomicBalanceCalculator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Guardrails/EconomicBalanceCalculator.cs) supplied only partial unchanged balances on terminal paths. The minimum result contract in [`Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md`](../Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md) requires every spending budget and Actions headroom.
- Impact: Clients cannot consistently render or persist complete projected state, especially for blocked and indeterminate outcomes.
- Resolution: `RemainingState` now exposes AI and Actions spending-budget headroom by stable budget ID. A centralized Engine snapshot supplies applicable unchanged pool, ULB, included-control, AI budget, Actions-minute, and Actions-budget balances to terminal paths; allowed operations replace those values with projected balances only after the corresponding meter permits the charge. The allocation-level AI balance dictionary remains available for compatibility.
- Verification: Engine contract tests cover allowed AI and Actions projections, multiple applicable budgets, alert-only negative headroom, economic and Actions blocks, soft stops, waiting, partial simulation, indeterminate paid-usage state, and preservation of known pooled balance when other seat inventory is unknown.

### F-06: `TrackingStartedAt` is persisted but ignored

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Medium
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`EconomicGuardrails.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Guardrails/EconomicGuardrails.cs) defined `TrackingStartedAt`, but Engine applicability and consumption did not use it. The flow document states that first-cycle pre-creation usage must not count toward the budget.
- Impact: First-cycle budget decisions can incorrectly include consumption from before tracking began, or callers can assume semantics the Engine does not implement.
- Resolution: Spending-budget applicability now starts inclusively at `TrackingStartedAt` and continues across later billing cycles while the budget remains effective. Before the baseline, the budget is neither evaluated nor included in remaining balances. `ConsumedUsd` is explicitly defined as consumption tracked since the baseline because scenarios do not contain dated usage history.
- Verification: Resolver tests cover timestamps before, at, after, and well after the tracking baseline. Engine tests confirm pre-baseline metered usage is not blocked, exact-boundary usage is evaluated, later-cycle usage remains constrained, and F-05 remaining balances use the same applicability decision.

### F-07: Configuration accepts undefined numeric enum values

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`EngineConfigurationLoader.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Configuration/EngineConfigurationLoader.cs) allowed integer enum deserialization, while [`EngineConfigurationValidator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Configuration/EngineConfigurationValidator.cs) did not validate all configuration enum values.
- Impact: Unknown values can silently enter fallback branches and change charging behavior rather than rejecting malformed configuration.
- Resolution: String enum conversion now rejects integers, and the validator checks every configuration enum at the programmatic boundary.
- Verification: Focused tests cover numeric and unknown string catalog values plus undefined programmatic values for both configuration enums.

### F-08: Duplicate scenario guardrail IDs are accepted

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`SimulationScenarioValidator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/SimulationScenarioValidator.cs) validated individual IDs but not collection uniqueness. [`EconomicBalanceCalculator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Guardrails/EconomicBalanceCalculator.cs) applies allocations by ID.
- Impact: One allocation can mutate multiple records with the same ID, making repeated simulation state ambiguous and non-reproducible.
- Resolution: Scenario validation now rejects IDs case-insensitively within every mutable guardrail collection.
- Verification: A focused contract test covers ULBs, included controls, spending budgets, and Actions budgets.

### F-11: Plan allowances are not effective-dated

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Large
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`EngineConfiguration.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Configuration/EngineConfiguration.cs) gave each plan one timeless `IncludedCreditsPerUser` value, and [`EconomicBalanceCalculator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Guardrails/EconomicBalanceCalculator.cs) applied it to every scenario timestamp. The lifecycle contract in [`Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md`](../Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md) requires effective-dated allowances.
- Impact: Historical and future simulations use the catalog's single current allowance even when a different allowance applied at the simulated time.
- Resolution: Plans now define non-overlapping allowance periods with inclusive start and exclusive end timestamps. Pool and cost-center entitlement resolve the period at the simulation timestamp. Missing periods and null allowances produce explicit unknown seat inventory, while empty, overlapping, invalid, and negative allowance periods are rejected as invalid configuration. The timeless allowance property was removed without a legacy fallback.
- Verification: Configuration tests cover empty, overlapping, invalid, and negative periods. Calculator tests cover historical values, exact boundaries, later values, gaps, pooled cost-center entitlement, and non-pooled plans. An Engine regression confirms that a missing effective allowance returns an indeterminate seat-inventory outcome.

### F-12: Duplicate call multipliers compound charges

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`SimulationScenarioValidator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/SimulationScenarioValidator.cs) validated multiplier identifiers but not uniqueness within a call. [`CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs) applies each list entry in sequence.
- Impact: Repeating the same case-insensitive multiplier ID in imported JSON silently multiplies the charge more than once.
- Resolution: Scenario validation now rejects duplicate enabled multiplier IDs case-insensitively before calculation.
- Verification: Focused contract tests cover exact-case duplicates, mixed-case duplicates, and distinct multiplier IDs.

### F-13: Configuration accepts blank stable identifiers

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`EngineConfigurationValidator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Configuration/EngineConfigurationValidator.cs) checked uniqueness and references for plan, model, operation, gate, multiplier, Actions runner, and tier IDs without first requiring nonblank identifiers.
- Impact: A catalog can pass Engine construction while containing entities that valid scenarios cannot reference reliably.
- Resolution: Configuration validation now requires nonblank stable IDs before uniqueness and reference processing, including nested price-tier IDs.
- Verification: Focused direct-validation and JSON-loader tests cover plans, models, operations, gates, multipliers, Actions runners, and tiers.

### F-14: Overlapping effective seats inflate shared entitlement

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small to medium
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`SimulationScenarioValidator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Simulation/SimulationScenarioValidator.cs) validated each seat period independently but did not reject overlapping periods for the same user. [`EconomicBalanceCalculator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Guardrails/EconomicBalanceCalculator.cs) summed every effective pooled seat when deriving enterprise and cost-center entitlement.
- Impact: Two effective pooled seats for one non-attributed user are counted as two licensed seats. This can overstate included-credit headroom and allow usage that should be metered or blocked. The attributed user is protected by F-01 ambiguity handling, but other pool members are not.
- Resolution: Scenario validation now rejects overlapping seat-assignment periods per user, using case-insensitive identity and inclusive-start/exclusive-end intervals. Adjacent and non-overlapping historical periods remain valid.
- Verification: Validator tests cover exact-boundary adjacency, partial and open-ended overlap, case-insensitive identity, distinct users, and non-overlapping history. Engine regressions prove duplicate effective seats cannot inflate enterprise-pool or cost-center entitlement.

### F-15: Browser save can persist a mixed state

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Medium
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`BrowserScenarioPersistence.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Web/Services/BrowserScenarioPersistence.cs) wrote scenario, catalog, and preferences to three independent local-storage keys in sequence.
- Impact: If the second or third write fails because storage is unavailable or full, the browser retains a new scenario with an old catalog or preferences. The next load can reject the mismatched state or restore behavior different from what the user saved.
- Resolution: Browser persistence now serializes scenario, catalog, and preferences into one versioned envelope and commits it with one `localStorage.setItem` call. Loading validates the envelope version and completeness before returning state to the existing transactional restoration path. Legacy three-key state is not loaded.
- Verification: Web service tests cover complete round trips, one-key storage, missing state, unsupported and incomplete envelopes, malformed-state preservation, invalid scenario and catalog preservation, and simulated write failure retaining the previously committed envelope.

### F-16: The Pages build job receives deployment credentials

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) granted `pages: write` and `id-token: write` at workflow scope, so checkout, restore, test, publish, and artifact preparation inherited permissions needed only by deployment.
- Impact: Build scripts and restored tooling execute with unnecessary ability to request an OIDC token and write Pages deployment state, increasing supply-chain blast radius.
- Resolution: Workflow-level permissions now grant only `contents: read`. The deploy job alone receives `pages: write` and `id-token: write`, while retaining read access for the pinned deployment action.
- Verification: YAML validation confirms the build job inherits only read-only contents permission, the deploy job has the two required deployment permissions, and every action remains pinned to a full commit SHA.

### F-17: Empty required catalogs pass configuration validation

- Severity: Medium
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`EngineConfigurationValidator.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/Configuration/EngineConfigurationValidator.cs) rejected null collection items but did not require `Plans` or `Operations` to contain an item. [`CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs`](../src/CopilotUsageSimulator.Engine/CopilotUsageSimulationEngine.cs) nevertheless requires every scenario to resolve both an operation and a plan.
- Impact: Engine construction succeeds for a configuration that cannot simulate any scenario, moving a catalog contract failure to every later request.
- Resolution: Configuration validation now requires at least one plan and one operation. Models, runners, gates, and multipliers remain optional.
- Verification: Direct-validator and JSON-loader tests reject empty plan and operation catalogs, while a focused regression confirms that optional catalogs may remain empty without references.

### F-09: Pages deployment has no test gate

- Severity: Low
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) published the Web project without first running the solution tests.
- Impact: Engine, Common, or Web regressions can reach GitHub Pages whenever publish itself succeeds.
- Resolution: The Pages build job now runs the Release solution test suite before configuring or publishing the Web project.
- Verification: The workflow's test command passes all solution tests, and publish remains downstream in the same fail-fast job.

### F-10: Gap-analysis documentation presents superseded behavior as current

- Severity: Low
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`Copilot-Guardrail-Gap-Analysis.md`](../Copilot-Guardrail-Gap-Analysis.md) and the pre-implementation matrix in [`Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md`](../Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md) described behaviors that have since been implemented or changed.
- Impact: Maintainers can design new work from an obsolete view of Engine capabilities.
- Resolution: Both matrices are now explicitly labeled as historical snapshots of the Engine state on 31 August 2026 and link to this review for current findings.
- Verification: Present-tense current-state matrix labels were removed from both historical documents.

### F-18: README reverses the current budget phase order

- Severity: Low
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`README.md`](../README.md) said Actions access and spending were evaluated before AI-credit allocation. After F-02, Actions access preflight remains early, economic guardrails and allocation run next, and the Actions spending budget runs only after economic approval.
- Impact: Integrators can reproduce the superseded sequence and report the wrong first failing constraint when both economic and Actions budgets fail.
- Resolution: The README now separates Actions access preflight from the economic and Actions spending phases and documents their current Engine order.
- Verification: The documented sequence matches the F-02 simultaneous-failure regression and [`Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md`](../Copilot-Token-Usage-Simulator-Flows.md).

### F-19: README usage sample does not compile

- Severity: Low
- Effort: Small
- Status: Resolved 2026-09-02
- Original evidence: [`README.md`](../README.md) assigned `new HashSet<string>` to `ModelCallInput.EnabledMultiplierIds`, whose contract is `IReadOnlyList<string>`.
- Impact: Consumers copying the primary Engine sample receive a compile-time conversion error before they can evaluate the library.
- Resolution: The sample now uses an ordered collection expression compatible with `IReadOnlyList<string>`.
- Verification: The complete README sample compiles against the current Engine project with zero warnings or errors.

## Low-Hanging Fruit

No open findings remain from this decision-flow review.

## Planning Dependencies

- F-20 through F-25 are resolved in the maintained remote Markdown and supporting research. The separately supplied SVG remains the original reviewed snapshot and was not regenerated; `sujithq/ghccp` does not store a generated SVG under `docs`.
- The [maintained local financial flow](decision-flow.md) now records those upstream resolutions and the preview/Actions clarifications. Its [unchanged upstream snapshot](reference/decision-flow.upstream-2026-09-12.md) is provenance only, not a second maintained specification.
- Preserve the F-01 selected-plan/effective-seat invariant when expanding entitlement or plan-selection behavior in other clients.
- Preserve the F-05 shared balance contract when changing terminal-path projections.
- Preserve the F-06 inclusive tracking-baseline semantics when changing spending-budget persistence or historical simulation.
- Preserve F-11 inclusive-start/exclusive-end allowance semantics when adding historical entitlement behavior or catalog periods.
- F-01 through F-25 are resolved.

## Verification Baseline

Initial review baseline:

- Worktree was clean.
- Release tests passed: 153 total.
- Release build succeeded with zero warnings and errors.
- No vulnerable direct or transitive NuGet packages were reported.

Historical 2026-09-02 implementation baseline:

- Worktree was clean before the F-17 implementation.
- Release tests passed: 218 total.
- Release build succeeded with zero warnings and errors.
- No vulnerable or deprecated direct or transitive NuGet packages were reported.
- `git diff --check` passed.

2026-09-12 decision-flow review baseline:

- Current checkout was clean at `a117c25` (`fix(engine): enforce declared pricing and eligibility constraints`) before this required ledger update.
- Read the attached SVG's node/edge labels and the supplied raw Mermaid source. Rechecked the official organization budgets/billing, individual billing/plans, budget setup, plan management, and code-review pages on 2026-09-12.
- Compared the financial sequence with current Engine allocation, applicability, terminal outcomes, profile, and immutable preview code, plus Web preview wiring and existing regression coverage.
- The prior session's completed Release baseline was 465 passing tests (Common 6, Engine 347, Web 112), with zero build warnings/errors. Tests/build were not rerun for this documentation-only review; this is not a fresh runtime or dependency-security certification.
- Only this ledger was edited; the analysis snapshots, implementation, attached SVG, and remote source were preserved.

Post-fix review at `4af0d7c` (`docs(flows): clarify request-sized capacity checks`):

- The new canonical-flow formulas and examples match the existing Engine behavior and introduce no implementation issue.
- F-20 remained open at that point because its reviewed source was the unchanged external Markdown/SVG; the local clarification was recorded as mitigation rather than resolution.
- `git diff --check` passed and VS Code reported no Markdown errors. Tests/build were not rerun for this documentation-only review.

Post-fix review of upstream F-20 resolution:

- Commits [`0b5dec1`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/0b5dec11c944ad3aca499efff5bc39f30cb3c3d4), [`6732d72`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/6732d72d5d3326d80eb9e92ef70445a7e2e7da77), and [`5e16df4`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/5e16df4a9a56c036a458ab61e74bb486b1792b05) applied the correction and two review repairs directly to `sujithq/ghccp` `main`.
- Review caught and repaired an uncontrolled-pool path that could appear to take the cost-center block edge, then tightened the block predicate to require X to exceed the cost-center control's own remaining headroom.
- The exact final commit and blob were re-read after the last repair. No remaining F-20 issue was found; at that checkpoint, F-21 through F-25 were still independently open.

Post-fix review of upstream F-21 resolution:

- Commit [`3e42a5e`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/3e42a5e6c7608b1eafddd11077cc80eb5857b3e0) changed the crossing-request allocation from a success-styled consumption step to a neutral projection and documented transactional rejection semantics.
- The exact committed blob was re-read against the Engine's terminal-result and immutable-preview contracts. No remaining F-21 issue or F-20 regression was found; at that checkpoint, F-22 through F-25 were still independently open.

Post-fix review of upstream F-22 resolution:

- Commit [`771aa1f`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/771aa1f2fec2501e433712a27396c0ef9ef07de1) separated paid authorization, hard stops, alert-only budgets, and missing-budget outcomes for individual and organization-paid paths.
- Review checked mixed hard-stop/alert-only applicability, USD 0 enforcement, and nonbudget account/payment/service limits. No remaining F-22 issue or F-20/F-21 regression was found; at that checkpoint, F-23 through F-25 were still independently open.

Post-fix review of upstream F-23 resolution:

- Commit [`5d8d42f`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/5d8d42f3330bf52db6547684337c6bf30dfdf544) added billed-identity/licensing-source attribution before ULB resolution and replaced the direct-only metered branch with resolved cost-center applicability.
- Review traced the selected identity through ULB, included-control, spending-budget, organization fallback, and enterprise-exclusion decisions. No remaining F-23 issue or F-20 through F-22 regression was found; at that checkpoint, F-24 and F-25 were still independently open.

Post-fix review of upstream F-24 resolution:

- Commit [`f03476d`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/f03476df85cc7ac0fb9472b02e00bc5ae15830eb) recast the diagram as a financial subflow with explicit prerequisites, funding-only terminals, product boundaries, and Compass support limits.
- Review checked stage ordering, transactional allocation, selected-identity applicability, Actions separation, special review attribution, and omitted Engine outcomes. No remaining F-24 issue or F-20 through F-23 regression was found; at that checkpoint, F-25 was still independently open.

Post-fix review of upstream F-25 resolution:

- Commit [`6a294c6`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/6a294c631842c6005195190995a3e0fdda84c37f) dated and qualified the decision-flow claims. Commits [`8a5d747`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/8a5d747a758b8b0665c4a2971b74f22aacbd7ee7) and [`091c833`](https://github.com/sujithq/ghccp/commit/091c833f07d3189ae9bec9408f38008f00e410ac) aligned the supporting research and repaired a stale USD 0 budget contradiction found during review.
- Review rechecked allowance totals/composition, reset timing, legacy cohort scope, Mobile-rule absence, request-sized headroom, transactional allocation, enforcement modes, attribution, and financial-subflow boundaries. No remaining F-25 issue or F-20 through F-24 regression was found.

Local copy/update requested 2026-09-12 at `588ed8d`:

- Saved the latest upstream `docs/decision-flow.md` at revision `6a294c631842c6005195190995a3e0fdda84c37f` unchanged as `docs/reference/decision-flow.upstream-2026-09-12.md`; its Git blob matches `6afce95bcbeeef22c8ba6045966e9db25128be96`.
- Added the maintained `docs/decision-flow.md` adaptation and README link without reverting any upstream finding resolutions. Fully included allocation is now explicitly provisional; personal hard budgets are checked before alert-only outcomes; remaining Actions approval and immutable-preview semantics are explicit.
- Reconfirmed the cohort-specific annual downgrade using the official legacy billing page, preserving F-25's resolution rather than reviving the earlier unverified claim.
- Implementation code, saved analyses, original SVG, and the remote repository were not modified. This is documentation-only work; no runtime test/build rerun is required.
- Snapshot bytes match the pinned upstream Git blob; the updated diagram's 54 node declarations, 68 edges, class references, reachability, and local document links passed structural checks. `git diff --check` passed.
